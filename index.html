                I started my journey at 16 by teaching English online and rapidly growing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moyassin" target="_blank">my first Facebook page</a> to over 70k likes in less than two months. 
                This initial success in digital marketing led to valuable collaborations with clients across the Arab world, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco. 
                Fueled by a passion for technology, I shifted to coding and independently developed tens of projects, handling everything from designing landing pages and managing databases to integrating AI functionalities.

            <p>
                I took on a teaching role as an experiment to explore new ways of creating useful solutions. I began by drawing students' portraits with AI, which went viral among educators

                This experience led me to a crucial realization: rather than focusing on solutions for students, I could create something that addresses teachers' needs and eases their challenges. 
                This insight inspired the development of <a href="https://jrnal.tn" target="_blank">Jrnal</a>â€”a tool designed to simplify and enhance the teaching experience.

                I'm also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@moyassin" target="_blank">techno-optimist</a>, believing in technology's power to drive positive change. 
                I enjoy listening to music and Iâ€™m a huuuge Kanye West fanâ€”<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/yourplaylistlink" target="_blank">my playlist</a>. 
                I also enjoy reading and am influenced by thinkers like Friedman, Hayek, and Nietzsche.
