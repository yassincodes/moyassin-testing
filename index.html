            <!-- The content remains unchanged -->
            <p>I'm currently building <a href="https://jrnal.tn" target="_blank">Jrnal</a>, the foundation for <a
                    href="https://anis.web.app" target="_blank">Anis</a> (your AI friend customised for your needs)!</p>
            <p>I started my journey at 16 by teaching English online and rapidly growing <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/moyassin" target="_blank">my first Facebook page</a> to over
                70k likes in less than three months. This initial success in digital marketing led to valuable
                collaborations with clients across the Arab world, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco. Fueled
                by a passion for technology, I shifted to coding and independently developed over 30 projects, handling
                everything from designing landing pages and managing databases to integrating AI functionalities.</p>
            <p>I took on a teaching role as an experiment to explore new ways of creating useful solutions. I began by
                drawing students' portraits with AI, which went viral among educators <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/moyassin" target="_blank" class="example-1">example 1</a><a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/moyassin" target="_blank" class="example-2">example 2</a>. This
                experience led me to a crucial
                realization: rather than focusing on solutions for students, I could create something that addresses
                teachers' needs and eases their challenges. This insight inspired the development of <a
                    href="https://jrnal.tn" target="_blank">Jrnal</a>â€”a tool
                designed to simplify and enhance the teaching experience.</p>
            <p>I'm also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@moyassin" target="_blank">techno-optimist</a>, believing in
                technology's power to drive positive change. I enjoy reading and
                am influenced by thinkers like Friedman, Hayek, and Nietzsche. You can <a
